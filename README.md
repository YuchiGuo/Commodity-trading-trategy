# Commodity-trading-trategy
23rd Oct 2023. G-Research coding challenge. 

A trading strategy that maximises the overall profit of trading a commodity between N cities, given the randomly generated transportation costs, probability of road closure, each cityâ€™s selling and buying prices together with maximum demand and supply. 

All routes are ranked by the profit generated, which takes into account the probability of route closure. 

In the order of their profitability, within each route, the numder of units of commodity is then decided. To decide the number of units of commodity transported along each route, we considered the simple working strategy which picks out the most profitable route and chooses either the maximum supply or the minimum demand, whichever is lower.
