# Commodity-trading-trategy
23rd Oct 2023. G-Research coding challenge. 

A trading strategy that maximises the overall profit of trading a commodity between N cities, given the randomly generated transportation costs, probability of road closure, each cityâ€™s selling and buying prices together with maximum demand and supply. 

To optimise the number of units of commodity transported along each route, we considered the simple working strategy which picks out the most profitable route and exhausts the lower value of maximum supply of from-city and demand from to-city. This operation is iterated over all routes in the order of their profitability.
